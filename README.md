# Python-Calculator-With-Travis-ci

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/Yash-2903/Python-Calculator-With-Travis-ci.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/Yash-2903/Python-Calculator-With-Travis-ci)

### This Statistic Calculator is Exdended of orginal Python Calculator. 
### All the Test case are validated in [Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/)

## Description

* You need to correctly use static methods, object methods, object attributes/properties.  
* You need to use the included files to load data for your unit tests.  Use each file to test the associated operation.
* You need to make at least 7 unit tests and should develop your tests as you write the program.
* Here is the CSV file we have to use to load the data [CSV files](https://github.com/Yash-2903/Python-Calculator-With-Travis-ci/tree/master/src/UnitTest/Data)
* Here we have to use Docker to run the test case for following operations.
* The grammar of programming is referred to as [SOLID](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/solid-design-principles-python-examples-hiral-amodia/?trk=public_profile_article_view) and is consistent for all object-oriented languages. 

## Program Requirements
* Demonstrating inheritance by extending the calculator
* Demonstrating encapsulation by having the calculator have methods and a result property
* Demonstrating abstraction by layering your code and using static methods.  Object methods should call static methods to perform the operation.
* Check values for being valid numbers and not strings
* Throw an exception for divide by zero 
* Throw exception for empty list
* Use random data for tests and be able to increase the number of calculations required i.e. be able to increase the list of numbers that the mean calculation is done on.  You can actually use built-in libraries or 3rd party libraries to check the calculations that you complete yourself.  i.e. you can use the standard deviation function from a stats library to compute the correct value for your list of random numbers and then use that to test that your own calculation is correct for that list.

## Random Generator Opertions:
* Generate a random number without a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
* Generate a random number with a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
* Generate a list of N random numbers with a seed and between a range of numbers - Both Integer and Decimal

## Arithematic Operations:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Square
* Square root

## Statistics Operations:
* Mean
* Median
* Mode
* Variance
* Standard Deviation
